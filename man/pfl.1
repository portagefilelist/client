searchable.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is the PFL upload command.
The purpose of this command is to collect the file names (not the
content) of all installed packages from the Gentoo and GURU repo and
upload them to portagefilelist.de.
After some time your uploaded data will be imported into a searchable
database.
Thus you will provide a way for other people to find a package which
contains a specific file/binary/command.
Please visit https://www.portagefilelist.de for further information.
